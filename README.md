This project integrates real-time monitoring and data-driven management into a CI/CD pipeline using AWS. It automates code deployment, monitors pipeline performance, and provides actionable insights through data analysis.

The pipeline uses AWS CodeCommit for version control, AWS CodePipeline to automate build and deployment, and AWS CodeBuild and CodeDeploy for handling these phases. What makes this architecture powerful is its integrated monitoring and analytics capabilities.

Amazon CloudWatch tracks logs and metrics, giving real-time visibility into the health and performance of the pipeline. AWS Lambda automates the processing of CloudWatch data, enabling scalable data handling without manual intervention.

(Because the data in the S3 Bucket is synthetic, both the BG and DEG pipelines occasionally encounter errors, causing the knowledge base to generate hallucinations less than 10% of the time.)
Data generated by the pipeline is stored in Amazon S3. Amazon Athena is then used to run SQL queries on this data, enabling quick, flexible analysis of logs and performance metrics. This allows for efficient bottleneck detection and process optimization. This combination of automated deployments, real-time monitoring, and detailed analytics ensures a scalable and efficient CI/CD process with deep operational insights.
